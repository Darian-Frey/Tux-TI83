## 🚀 Overview

Tux-TI83 is designed to bridge the gap between traditional graphing calculators and modern computing power. It treats mathematical state as a graph-addressable machine, allowing for complex matrix operations, real-time function graphing, and modular logic evaluation.

### Core Architecture

* **Engine:** Custom Recursive Descent Parser / Shunting-Yard Evaluator.
* **Protocol:** SCHEMA_V5 (State Machine Logic + Capsule-Based Memory).
* **UI:** Nord-themed QML interface with high-density information transfer.
* **Math:** Polymorphic stack supporting both Scalars and Matrices ([A] through [E]).

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Graphing Engine

* **Multi-Function Plotting:** Graph up to 3 functions simultaneously (Y1, Y2, Y3).
* **Interactive Viewport:** Real-time Pan (Click-Drag) and Zoom (Scroll-Wheel).
* **Z-Logic:** Quick-access ZStandard and Zoom Fit settings.
* **Coordinate Mapping:** High-contrast grid with dynamic axis labeling.

### 🧮 Matrix Processing

* **Operations:** Supports Matrix Addition, Scalar Multiplication, and Matrix-Matrix Multiplication.
* **Grid Editor:** Interactive 3x3 UI for defining matrix data.
* **Registry:** Persistently store and recall matrices [A], [B], and [C].

### 🛠 Logic & Boolean

* **Relational:** =, ≠, <, >, <=, >=.
* **Boolean:** and, or, not, xor.
* **Fractional:** ▶Frac conversion for scalar results.
